# GNOME Books

Google Summer of Code project for GNOME.

Books is application for listing, searching and reading eBooks.

Books will be implemented upon the application gnome-documents, and it is going to live in the same git repository. This would be a great solution regarding code duplication, because it would be possible to reuse relevant code blocks from gnome-documents and add extra features related to eBooks.

Using epub.js library for the reading mode.

The idea is to integrate Books with an existing online eBook store.

## 1. Installing GNOME Books

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd src/ && glib-compile-resources gnome-books.gresource.xml
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/src/.libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    $ export GI_TYPELIB_PATH=`pwd`/src

## 2. Running GNOME Books

Make a folder Books in your $home directory and add all the .epubs you would like to read.

    $ gnome-books
When GNOME Books is running choose your eBook and press 'Load Table of Contents'. This will load the chapters and notify you when finished with the pop-up bar. Next you should click on 'Load Total Pages' and you are ready to enjoy your EBook. 
(These steps should be removed in the future.)
